      "Romeo ask Nutscracker why he's so sure about the message been for a long time, Nutscracker answers he saw it several hours ago. After that all 3 characters ask each other, do they remember how they end up here. After that Nutscracker ask to describe their surrounding by each of characters. They find around similar hotel rooms. Organizm tries to knock in the door, and Romeo tries to knock in the wall to no avail.",
      "Organizm suggests checking if their computers have any other functionality or messages beyond the chat. Romeo finds only a basic web interface without internet access, imitating chatroom of Guardian newspaper with the only chat thread. Organizm then proposes a theory that they're part of an experiment or test. Nutscracker and Romeo cautiously agree to search their rooms for any hidden clues or unusual features, describing features of their rooms real-time."
