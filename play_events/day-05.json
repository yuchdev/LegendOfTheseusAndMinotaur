It looked dark and oppressive, as though there was a fire there a long time ago and afterwards they tried several times to fix it up, but they hadn't been able to. It was the same inside. It felt like a camouflaged smouldering ruin. I can't even say what it was that gave me the feeling. Everything was new, expensive and chic - like in those glass palaces they rent out for offices. The air was cool and clean, there wasn't the slightest smell of burning in it at all.

Further away still there were dark-blue mountains, or perhaps they were clouds in the sunset. I didn't have time to look at anything else, because then one of the dwarves appeared in the corridor. He was in a hurry to get somewhere and looking quite aggressive - his loose robe was caught in with a belt that had a little sabre dangling on it. He didn't stop, just gestured for me to follow him. We began climbing the stairs. I asked him a question, but he told me to keep quiet. He said his master was under threat - they wanted to kill him. And so all questions and answers were now being strictly documented. I asked who wanted to kill his master, but he muttered that the reply to that question had to be documented as well. We came to a large open area with identical shelves of files on all the walls - it looked like some kind of archive. There was a kind of double round table in the centre - about fifty centimetres above the table-top there was a smaller disc of wood that could rotate. They used to have something of the sort in old canteens so that people could move any dish within reach by turning the upper disc. The dwarf sat down at the table and pointed to the place opposite him. I sat down. On the table in front of me there was an inkwell with a genuine goose-quill pen and a file containing sheets of paper. The dwarf had an identical inkwell and file. He told me to write down my question and put the sheet of paper on the wooden disc. I wrote: 'Who wants to kill the Minotaur?' The quill actually wrote very easily, with a fine line. Meanwhile the dwarf took a sheet of paper out of his file and wrote something himself. We put the sheets of paper on the rotating wooden disc, the dwarf turned it through a hundred and eighty degrees, then he had my question in front of him and I had his answer. It was brief: 'You already know'. And it was written on paper headed with a crest. Apparently he didn't even need to read my question, he already knew it.",

But since the helmet of horror is in no way the one thing that is, it is also one of the multitude of things that are not. And the things that are not may enter into every possible conceivable and inconceivable kind of relationship, since these relationships do not in any case exist anywhere except in the helmet of horror, which does not actually exist itself.'\nQuestion:\n'Does this mean that inside the helmet there is another helmet and in the other helmet there is a third one and so on to infinity in both directions?'\nAnswer:\n'An individual by the name of A may be a part of the helmet of horror worn by B, and an individual by the name of B may at the same time be a part of the helmet of horror worn by A. This is the final infinity in both directions, and often both of them are quite nice people.'\nQuestion:\n'Can you please say something about the occipital braid.'\nAnswer:\n'Longer and thicker suits the girl better.'",

A third claims these columns should be understood metaphorically and the labyrinth is created by the two mental nodules or hemispheres, which are symbolised by the two horns. And so on. And here at the end there are a few pages about this Julistan. They look quite different, really ancient and faded. Many of them are so old I can hardly make anything out. Covered with strange, beautiful handwriting. They're translations of inscriptions from the Julistan caves.
